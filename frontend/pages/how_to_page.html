<h1>A Tutorial To TETRIS</h1>
<p>Use arrow keys left and right to move the blocks horizontally.</p>
<p>Arrow key up rotates the block.</p>
<p>Arrow key down increases the speed of the block falling.</p>
<p>Pressng the Space Bar allows you to 'hard drop' meaning the block will immediately reach the bottom.</p>
<p><b>If you stack the blocks too high the game is over!!</b></p>
<p>As the lines are cleared , the levels increase and so does the speed of the falling blocks .</p>
<p>Clearing multiple rows at once increases your scoring opportunities. </p>

<p><b>Score as many points as possible by clearing every square within a row!!!</b></p>
