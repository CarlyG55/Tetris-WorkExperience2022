<h1>A Tutorial To TETRIS</h1>
<p>In TETRIS you can either use your keyboard OR your mouse to play.</p>
<h2><b>KEYBOARD</b></h2>
<p>Use arrow keys left and right to move the blocks horizontally.</p>
<p>Arrow key up rotates the block to the right.</p>
<p>Pressing Z can rotate the block to the left.</p>
<p>Arrow key down increases the speed of the block falling.(This is called a Soft Drop)</p>
<p>By pressing the Space Bar the block will immediately reach the bottom.(This is called a Hard Drop)</p>
<p>By Pressing C you can hold the block.</p>
<p>By pressing the Esc Key you can pause your game</p>

<h2>MOUSE</h2>
<p>You can move the block right or left with the help of your mouse moving horizontally.</p>
<p>Right Mouse button will hold the block in place.</p>
<p>Left Mouse button will cause a hard drop (Immediately reaches the bottom)</p>

<p>(We recommend using a mouse since it's easier and more fast-paced compared to using a keyboard.)</p>

<h3>Main Rules and SCORING</h3>

<p>As the rows are cleared , the levels increase and so does the speed of the falling blocks .</p>
<p>Clearing multiple rows at once increases your scoring opportunities. </p>
<p><b>If you stack the blocks too high the game is over!!</b></p>
<hr>

<p><b>Score as many points as possible by clearing every square within a row!!!</b></p>
