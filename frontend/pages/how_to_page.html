<h1>A Tutorial To TETRIS</h1>
<hr>
<p>In TETRIS you can either use your keyboard OR your mouse to play.</p>

<h4>KEYBOARD</h4>

<p>• Use arrow keys left and right to move the blocks horizontally.</p>
<p>• Arrow key up rotates the block to the right.</p>
<p>• Pressing Z can rotate the block to the left.</p>
<p>• Arrow key down increases the speed of the block falling to 2 squares at a time.(This is called a Soft Drop)</p>
<p>• By pressing the Space Bar the block will increase the speed to 3 squares.(This is called a Hard Drop)</p>
<p>• By Pressing C you can hold the block.</p>
<p>• By pressing the Esc Key you can pause your game</p>

<h2>MOUSE</h2>

<p>You can move the block right or left with the help of your mouse moving horizontally.</p>
<p>Right Mouse button will hold the block in place.</p>
<p>Left Mouse button will cause a hard drop (Immediately reaches the bottom)</p>

<h5>(We recommend using a mouse since it's easier and more fast-paced compared to using a keyboard.)</h5>

<h3>Main Rules and SCORING</h3>

<p>As the rows are cleared , the levels increase and so does the speed of the falling blocks .</p>
<p>Clearing multiple rows at once increases your scoring opportunities. </p>
<p>★ For every row cleared you get 100 points.</p>
<p>★ If two rows are cleared at once you get 200 extra points adding up to 300.</p>
<p>★ And if THREE rows are cleared at once you gain 500 total points!!</p>
<hr>

<p><b>If you stack the blocks too high the game is over!!</b></p>
<p><b>Score as many points as possible by clearing every square within a row!!!</b></p>
